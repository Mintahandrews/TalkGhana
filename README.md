# TalkGhana - Ghanaian Language Speech Platform

TalkGhana is a comprehensive platform for developing and training speech models for Ghanaian languages. Our tools enable natural speech synthesis and accurate speech recognition across multiple Ghanaian languages.

## Core Capabilities

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generate natural-sounding speech in Ghanaian languages
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Transcribe Ghanaian language audio with high accuracy
- **Language Support**: Twi, Ga, Ewe, Hausa, and Ghanaian English
- **Data Management**: Tools for collecting and processing language datasets

## Features

### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Training

Our platform provides state-of-the-art speech synthesis capabilities:

- Multiple model architectures (FastSpeech, Tacotron, GlowTTS, VITS)
- Phonetic mapping optimized for Ghanaian languages
- Advanced tonal features for natural prosody
- Syllable-level modeling for improved pronunciation

### Speech-to-Text (STT) Training

Robust speech recognition with:

- Modern architectures (Conformer, QuartzNet, Wav2Vec, Whisper-style)
- Specialized vocabulary tools for Ghanaian languages
- Optimized feature extraction for Ghanaian speech patterns
- Configurable audio preprocessing

### Data Management

Comprehensive tools for:

- Audio and text data collection
- Language-specific text normalization
- Audio preprocessing and augmentation
- Dataset analytics and visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- TensorFlow.js
- React
- Python (optional, for advanced features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/talkghana.git
cd talkghana
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Install ML libraries:

```bash
npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps @tensorflow-models/speech-commands @huggingface/inference iso-639-1 compromise compromise-syllables natural csv-parser
```

4. Set up data directories:

```bash
mkdir -p data/{audio,text}/{raw,processed}/{twi,ga,ewe,hausa,english} data/models data/training_logs
```

### Using TalkGhana

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Access the interface at `http://localhost:3000`

3. Available features:
   - Dataset management
   - Model training configuration
   - Model export and deployment

## Training Models

### TTS Model Training

1. Select your target language
2. Choose a TTS model architecture
3. Configure training parameters
4. Start the training process

The system handles:

- Dataset preprocessing
- Model initialization
- Training monitoring
- Model evaluation and export

### STT Model Training

1. Choose your target language
2. Select an STT architecture
3. Configure audio parameters
4. Begin training

### Best Practices

- Start with small datasets to validate configurations
- Enable tonal features for tonal languages
- Use syllable-level modeling for better pronunciation
- Ensure diverse speaker representation in STT training
